# Ansible Stack

This is an Ansible playbook stack that you can use to provision some web hosting
infrastructure and stuff like that.

Please check out each role’s README file for more details on how to configure
them; in particular, it should contain a description of the role’s configurable
variables, and an example playbook to demonstrate the role’s usage (which will
generally make use of the role’s default values as example values).

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS remote host(s) with root access
- Ansible 2.8

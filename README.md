This is a collection of Ansible roles and their standard playbook
implementation, aiming at facilitating the provisioning of Ubuntu LTS servers
that provide typical Internet services (Apache, MySQL, Docker deployment, etc.)

This project is still very much a work in progress, but offers some good
foundation for now.

## TODO

- [ ] Maybe restrict user access through `sshd`â€™s `AllowUsers` config directive
- [ ] Set up a CI workflow
- [ ] Write the docs
